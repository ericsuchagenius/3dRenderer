This is a Renderer project and contains several classes

1. Renderer.java
task: main class
aim: to create the main class for this program and to initialize every class
future implementation: to implement object creation
variables:
    Width: stores the width of the screen
    Height: stores the height of the screen
    viewFrom: the view vector for the calculation
    viewTo: the vector that people will view to
    initializeData: this is the data that initialize the objManager class, contains the data for all of the objects
    colors: contains all the colors for the objects, implement texture pack in future
    screenObject: an instance of objManager that is mainly used for control

2. objManager.java
task: to manage all of the 3d objects and call the main loop that refresh and calculates the projection of the objects
aim: to manage objects and every thing together
future implementation: to implement triangulation method and probably ray tracing
    variables:
    numObjects: this is the number of objects that is stored
    objects: this is a list that stores all the instances of threeDObj

3. threeDObj.java
task: to manage the data for each 3d object such as the coordinates for the points
aim: to act as a small storage class that stores information about the object
future implementation: to create texture class and combine both class to define a 3d object
variables:
    data: this is the data for the object
    numPoly: this is the number of polygon that compose the object
    color: the color of your objects
    computedPoints: the computed points of your object

4. calculator.java
task: to turn 3d coordinates into 2d coordinates based on viewTo and viewFrom vector
aim: a static class that needs input and output and gives an output
future implementation: to solve existing bugs about some translation
variable: there isn't any true variable because this is only just a calculator for the program

5.Vector.java
task: this is a 3d vector class that stores the value of points
aim: to act as a storage and provide calculations of the dot product
future implementation: no improvements
variable: there isn't any true variable because this is only just a storage of a vector for the object

conclusions:
The renderer works now but lacks further implementations, such as triangulation and 3d object creation.
This will all be implemented in future classes.
